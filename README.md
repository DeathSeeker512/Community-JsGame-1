#Community-JsGame-1

====

A community driven game made in javascript.

## Tasks 

  + `grunt` (or `grunt default`) to compile `dev/cs/\*.coffee` to `dev/cs/\*.js`

  + `grunt build` to put in `build/` (compiling and minfying js only atm)

  + `grunt test` to compile specs from coffeescript to javascript (browser-based)
