#Ideas:
    
  - from Chickenskill

      - mix of a dungeon crawler and a rpg

      - pikachu

      - rng event ( like introduced by Tera)

      - something to wear or activate to get another gameplay (like majora's mask, or Zelda in general)

      - mount (horses) 

      - the prince/usual hero get kidnapped, the heroine is the princess

      - u can select between mage princess, warrior princess, rogue princess

      - the mount = poney

      - no mana, berserker mode ( the more u fight, the more u can spell)

      - 2 worlds like in Zelda

      - u can burn houses

      - harvest moon inspired, u have a house where u can make grow stuff -> for the craft concept

      - competence tree

      - passive abilities ( proc critical hit) thant can be up with level

      - when flying mounts, u use them to go to a destination point. u choose a destination point, then the gameplay is a shmup
      where u have to kill ennemies until u reach this point

#Note for Deathseeker from Chickenskill

  i ve tried to run makefile.sh from a manjaro (archlinux fork) nude (only git installed) and it worked well :/

  if u only code in js u wont have to grunt since it just precompile and build, everything should works fine without

  but i wanted to show u what does grunt :(
